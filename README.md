# Chow-Chow

Chow-Chow<sup>[1]</sup> is an FM synth.<sup>[2]</sup> It's in
early development right now, but it will soon support an
arbitrary number of operators as well as arbitrarily complex FM
algorithms. Current focus is on the library, but once the library
is mature, standalone and plugin graphical frontends are on the
roadmap as well.

1. Named in honor of John Chowning, FM synthesis pioneer.
1. Technically it's a phase modulation synth, like most FM synths
   in practice.
